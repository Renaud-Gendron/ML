# Machine Learning Project with the Titanic Dataset

In this project, I used different machine learning algorithms to make  predictions to know if passengers survived or died on the Titanic. Before using these tools, I cleaned the data and I did some EDA to evaluate which variables should be included in the model. I used R for this project. Here is the link:
